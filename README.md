# endinir

Endinir (pt-BR sound joke for "Engineer") is a project aiming to help newcomers on understanding basics and fundamentals of Software Engineering.

It's not a *course*, nor a *bootcamp*, but instead a set of missing pieces for those who may have or not completed courses but still need to grasp some concepts.
